     <p>Sherrie did hair and make up for my mom, my 4 bridesmaids, and I. She was very professional and efficient, as usual. I had been getting my hair cut and colored by Sherrie for about 2 years prior to the wedding. I have always been pleased with her work! Sherrie helped complete the wedding day by making us all look like red carpet celebs!! She is also easy to talk to and makes you feel comfortable as a client. I live in GA now but she does mine and my husband's hair if we are ever in town! :)</p>
