						You have your dress, you have your bouquet….  Now let’s talk wedding hair and make-up!  I will be there to help you decide on the look you have been dreaming of and will assure you that it will be beautifully done and HD ready.
					</p>
					<p>
						At this early stage I need to know a few details about your wedding day. You can fill in the contact form. You have no obligation to book at this time and I will provisionally hold your date for two weeks after I receive your wedding details. After this date I have to open your wedding date to other brides but I will send you a reminder email before I do this.
					</p>
                                        <h3>Confirm your booking</h3>
					<p>
						To secure your wedding date, I ask a non-refundable booking fee of $150 which will also be deducted from your final balance. A confirmation e-mail will be sent out to you as a receipt along with the contract.
					</p>
                                        <h3>Trials</h3>
					<p>
						I highly recommend a bridal trial around 8 weeks before your wedding date, but it is completely at your discretion if you wish to have it any earlier. I will travel to you for your trial (travel costs will apply) or it may be done in salon. Your trial will last approximately 2 – 3 hours.  All bridal trials are half off.   Once we decide on a style at your trial/s, I will then take a picture to replicate your style on the wedding day.
					</p>
                                        <h3>Wedding Day</h3>
					<p>
						I will arrive at your chosen venue for your hair and make-up.  Depending on how many additional people in the bridal party, it will dictate the order we proceed in. Parties of 4 or more will receive Mimosas and a fruit tray. All I ask of you is that you provide a low comfortable chair for you to sit on, access to a plug socket and a small space for me to place my equipment on if I go on site.  I will be with you from the moment I arrive right up until you are ready for your final touches.   I will also place any hair accessories and your veil for you so it is absolutely perfect on your special day.
					</p>
                                        <h3>***Terms and Condtions***</h3>
					<p>
						A non-refundable booking fee of $150 is required to secure your wedding date and will be deducted from your final balance. Payment of your bill is required the day you book.  Checks, money order, credit, and cash is accepted for the booking fee.  . Cancellations less than 6 weeks before the wedding will incur the full outstanding balance.
					</p>
                                        <p>
						Note – traveling costs apply.  On-Site fee starts at $50
					</p>
                                        <p>
						I love to use my own and the professional photographs for my website and advertising. Please let me know if you want to be excluded from this.
